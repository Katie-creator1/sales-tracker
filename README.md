## What It Does

- Reads product IDs from a `.txt` file
- Uses a dictionary to match each ID with a product name and price
- Generates a `sale_id` and adds the current date
- Outputs all sales to a CSV file, with headers and clean formatting
- Useful for simulating basic point-of-sale export logic

---

## Skills Practiced

- File I/O: `open()`, `.readlines()`, `.writerow()`, `.writerows()`
- Dictionary lookups and nested data access
- Clean data parsing using `.strip()`
- Using `csv` and `datetime` modules
- Writing reusable, readable Python code

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in modules: `csv`, `datetime`
